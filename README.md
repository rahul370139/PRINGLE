# 🧠 Generative AI for Content Creation – Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB)

Welcome to the **CAFB AI Content Assistant** project – a prototype solution for **Case 3** of the AI & Food Insecurity Case Competition.

## 🧩 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Help the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) streamline their content creation process using **Generative AI**. CAFB staff currently spend a lot of time creating grant proposals, reports, social media posts, newsletters, and presentations. This project aims to build a solution that uses **AI to generate high-quality content drafts**, saving time while enhancing communication effectiveness.

## 📌 Problem Statement

CAFB needs a way to:
- Quickly draft documents with consistent tone and messaging
- Personalize content for different audiences (donors, volunteers, funders)
- Integrate text, visuals, and structured data into coherent narratives

**Can generative AI be that assistant?**  
This project explores that question by developing a smart assistant that helps write, format, and adapt CAFB's communications across multiple platforms and formats.

## 💡 Key Features (Planned/Prototype)

- 📝 **AI Writing Assistant**: Generates draft content for grant proposals, blog posts, social media, and more.
- 🎯 **Audience-aware Output**: Tailors tone and structure for different target readers (e.g., funders vs. Facebook followers).
- 🖼️ **Multimodal Integration**: Supports images and structured data (optional features).
- 📊 **Template-Driven UX**: Users choose a content type and fill out prompts to get AI-generated text.
- ✅ **Human-in-the-Loop**: Ensures all content can be edited by staff before use.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Frontend/UI**: VS Code, Streamlit (or Flask prototype)
- **Backend AI**: OpenAI GPT (or similar), LangChain (optional)
- **Possible Extensions**: Image captioning, document embedding, CSV/statistic summarization
